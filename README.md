# LaserWesternDuel
Arduino project in the scope of the Project I course for Electrical and Computer Engineering, in FCTUC.
## v0.0 - Diogo Vasco & Rodrigo Gon√ßalves

## Project Description
Classic [Western Duel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC6jnHFdqbQ) with two players facing wall-mounted targets. Players use 3D printed laser guns, mounted by ourselves, and the winner is determined by who hits their target the fastest.

Extra game mode focusing on reaction timing, where players must hit a sequence of multiple targets as they light up randomly. Similiar to [AimLabs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVxbQ0OeCi4).
